\arguments{
\item{df_counts_and_p_hat}{A data.frame returned by the function: \code{\link[=estimate_p_hat]{estimate_p_hat()}}}

\item{\dots}{Further arguments.}
}
\value{
Returns a data.frame containing:
\itemize{
\item H1_group, Name of population group 1
\item H2_group, Name of population group 2
\item number_hosts_sampled_group_1, Number of individuals sampled from population group 1
\item number_hosts_sampled_group_2, Number of individuals sampled from population group 2
\item number_hosts_population_group_1, Estimated number of individuals in population group 1
\item number_hosts_population_group_2, Estimated number of individuals in population group 2
\item max_possible_pairs_in_sample, Number of distinct possible transmission pairs between individuals sampled from population groups 1 and 2
\item max_possible_pairs_in_population, Number of distinct possible transmission pairs between individuals in population groups 1 and 2
\item num_linked_pairs_observed, Number of observed directed transmission pairs between samples from population groups 1 and 2
\item p_hat, Probability that pathogen sequences from two individuals randomly sampled from their respective population groups are linked
\item c_hat, Probability that a randomly selected pathogen sequence in one population group links to at least
one pathogen sequence in another population group i.e. probability of clustering
}
}
\description{
This function estimates \code{c_hat}, the probability that a randomly
selected pathogen sequence in one population group links to at least
one pathogen sequence in another population group.
