\description{
Counts of directed HIV transmission pairs observed within and between
intervention and control communities in the 30-community BCPP/Ya Tsie
HIV prevention trial in Botswana (2013-2018). The Botswana -Ya Tsie
trial was a pair-matched community randomized trial that evaluated
the effect of a universal HIV test and treat intervention in reducing
population-level incidence. For further details see references and:
