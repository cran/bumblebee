\title{Bumblebee: Quantify Disease Transmission Within and Between Population Groups}
\description{
Bumblebee uses counts of directed transmission pairs identified between samples
from population groups of interest to estimate the flow of transmissions within
and between those population groups accounting for sampling heterogeneity.

Population groups might include: communities, geographical regions, age-gender
groupings or arms of a randomized-clinical trial.

Counts of observed directed transmission pairs can be obtained from deep-sequence
phylogenetic data (via phyloscanner) or known epidemiological contacts. Note:
Deep-sequence data is also commonly referred to as high-throughput or
next-generation sequence data. See references to learn more about phyloscanner.
}
\section{The \code{estimate_transmission_flows()} function}{

To estimate transmission flows, that is, the relative probability of transmission
within and between population groups accounting for variable sampling the among
the population groups the function: \code{estimate_transmission_flows_and_ci()}
computes the conditional probability, \code{theta_hat} that a pair of pathogen
sequences is from a specific population group pairing given that the pair is
linked.

For two population groups of interest \eqn{(u,v)} \code{theta_hat} is denoted by

\deqn{\hat{\theta_{ij}} = Pr(pair from groups (i,j) | pair is linked), where i = u,v and j = u,v .}

To learn more and try some examples, see documentation of the
\code{estimate_transmission_flows()} function and the bumblebee package
